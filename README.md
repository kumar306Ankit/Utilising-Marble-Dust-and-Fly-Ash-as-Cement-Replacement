# Utilising-Marble-Dust-and-Fly-Ash-as-Cement-Replacement

This study explores the use of marble dust and fly ash as partial replacements for cement in M25 concrete, addressing both environmental waste and concrete performance. Marble production in regions like Rajasthan generates large quantities of waste, while fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, accumulates in India. The paper investigates the effect of replacing 20% of cement with these waste materials, testing the concrete mixtures for compressive strength, workability, and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV).
